                    All meaningful 3D design was done in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators">
                    Fusion360</a>. The files are all cloud based, so use the utility below to explore the design and download the files. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'trapped nuts' in the design are not shown in the 3D model, nor are any of the electronics. These are all depicted by 
                    voids, except for the heated bed itself. The heated bed is a the core of the defining the shape of the entire incubator and 
                    is therefore depicted. Seeral other dimensions were important in the design, and they were depicted only in the parameters, 
                    rather than being directly depicted in the 3D model.
