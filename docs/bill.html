                <h1>A Device to Make Tempeh</h1>
                <p>
                    Here is a complete list of all of the materials used to build the Countertop Incubator. Downloadable csv is 
                    <a href="billofmaterials.csv">HERE</a>. Altogether, the whol project cost over $80USD and it could have been 
                    much more than that if I had to buy everything new. Most of the parts that were used, I already had.
                    This simple fact informed many of my design choices, yet didn't really feel like a constraint. Since I was 
                    doing this whole project without any hope for optimization for mass production, shaving all my costs to 
                    their very smallest wasn't the prime motivation. Mostly, I just wanted my girlfriend to end up with a 
                    working tempeh incubator, that could fit on a coutnertop. Goal achieved!

                    The heated bed is the largest piece, and what set a lower limit to the size of the device. If anyone 
                    else wants to build an incubator, you could certainly get a different heated bed and power unit.
                    I believe that both of mine are oversized for what they need to be, but (again) I wasn't trying to 
                    optimize too much. One other noteworthy part is the heated bed controller. Frankly, I didn't want to 
                    bother with making my own solution to controlling a heated bed, when the good people who design open-source 
                    3D printers with <a href='http://reprap.org/'>RepRap</a> had already done all that work. Buying the heated bed controller (as well as using the Arduino) 
                    are the two largest indicators that this is a hobby project, rather than a buisness venture. These choices 
                    also keep the design from being the 'fabbiest' thing around. Certainly much less 'fabby' than 
                    <a href='http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=328'>GaudiLab's Incubator Controller</a> or the 
                    <a href='https://biodesign.cc/2013/12/25/diy-incubator/'>Biodesign DIY Incubator</a>.
                    However, my version has the controller, power supply and heater all intgrated into one device that could 
                    work in a home kitchen. [And, really? Can't the end justify the means?]
