                <h1>A Device to Make Tempeh</h1>
                <p>
                    There are many great foods to eat in the world, and Tempeh is one of them. It is a foodstuff that is similar to tofu in some ways; but quite different in others. 
                    Tempeh often has a nicer texture than tofu, and is just as adaptable in flavor. "Hipster Tofu" is the shortest way to describe tempeh to a naieve and disinterested 16-year-old.

                <p>
                    My girlfriend loves tempeh, so I decided to make her a kitchen appliance to make the stuff. Upon researching tempeh further, I was suprised to find that it is grown as a mold on a variety of beans.
                    The growing process has been done naturally inside of banan leaves in Indonesia for years, but holding the incubating temperature in Indonesia is not a problem. In Cleveland, you can never count on the weather to be warm. 
                    Since the climate would not provide the needed incubation temperatures, building a countertop incubator seemed like the next logical choice... After searches rendered no off-the-shelf products that would work.
                    So I set to work. There were some lightbulb based designs available from across the FabLab network, and a controller available for the BioAcademy buildable inventory; but neither of these excited me.
                    I designed an incubator that could be built cheaply from spare 3D printer parts I had laying around in the lab. This design is a mash-up of Makergear M2 printer parts and RepRap parts. Although, any spare heated bed parts could work.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy the design and that it may be useful for you. IF you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
